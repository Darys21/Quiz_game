# Quiz Game
This program is a quiz game that asks a user a series of 20 random questions pulled from an API. The user must answer each question and receives a score at the end based on how many questions were answered correctly.

# Functionality
The program uses the Open Trivia DB API to retrieve 20 random trivia questions in a variety of categories, including history, science, and entertainment. The user is prompted to answer each question and can choose from a set of multiple-choice answers. Once all questions have been answered, the program displays the user's score and the correct answers to each question.

To run the program, the user must have Python 3 installed on their machine, as well as the requests library. The program can be run by navigating to the directory containing the quiz_game.py file in a terminal window and running the command python quiz_game.py.

# Usage
To play the quiz game, simply run the quiz_game.py file using the command python quiz_game.py. Once the program is running, follow the on-screen prompts to answer each question. After all questions have been answered, the program will display your final score.
